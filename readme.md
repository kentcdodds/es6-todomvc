# Vanilla JavaScript TodoMVC Example

## Purpose

This was originally part of [an ES6 training](http://bit.ly/es6-intro-slides) by [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)

Now I'm using it to teach people about [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).

## Thanks

This codebase was originally taken from the TodoMVC project starting [here](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/563d1e1b8cee5f6ec962ec43663cb66a72b69d76/examples/vanillajs). Big thanks to them!

## Project Setup

1. Fork the GitHub Repo
2. Clone your Fork
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run validate`
5. If everything's running without errors, you can start checking out the available branches (`git remote show origin`)

## Notes

Because Webpack 2 is currently in beta, there are issues with `peerDependencies`, so youâ€™ll have to use npm version 3 to be able to install the dependencies.
